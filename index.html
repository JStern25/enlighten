    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        We believe learning -- for a class, job, side project, or just out of curiosity -- and being able to truly understand and apply knowledge about the world could be a much better experience.
        <br><br>
        In today's world, with billions of people connected by the Internet to each other and endless resources for learning, <span class="bold-p">we believe anyone should be able to learn anything quickly and affordably.</span> Learning something new may always be a challenge, but the experience should be closer to streaming an episode of your favorite show or working on an exciting project with friends, rather than listening to a long lecture in class or studying for a difficult test.
        <br><br>
        That's why <span class="bold-p">our mission is to make the journey of learning and applying knowledge a more "enlightened" one</span> -- one that's more engaging and social, and less confusing and costly. We aim to do this by more effectively connecting people like you who want to learn with the people and resources who can help you learn best.
        <br><br>
        Society and technology are changing rapidly, so it's becoming ever more important to not only understand the world, but also know how to change it for the better. <span class="bold-p">Our vision is that Enlighten will result in a world where anyone and everyone can use their "enlightened" minds to help build a better future together, sooner.</span>
